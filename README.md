# ME-100-MATLAB-CODE
This repository contains the code used for Semester Project of Engineering Mechanics. The project titled **Study of Factors Affecting the Motion of Crankshaft and Kinematic Analysis of Crankshaft Mechanism** studies how changes in parameters like rod lenght,crank radius,rod ratio affect the speed and acceleration. 
MATLAB is used for creating plots and simulation of a running crankshaft.
